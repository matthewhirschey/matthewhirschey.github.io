&lt;p&gt;I’m very excited to announce my latest project, a book on data visualization. The working title is “Fundamentals of Data Visualization”. The book will be published with O’Reilly, and a preview is &lt;a href=&#34;https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/&#34;&gt;available here.&lt;/a&gt; The entire book is written in R Markdown, and the figures are made with ggplot2. The source for the book is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz&#34;&gt;available on github.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the entire book is written in R Markdown, it is not a book on programming. The book is meant as a guide to making visualizations that accurately reflect the data, tell a story, and look professional. It has grown out of my experience of working with students and postdocs in my laboratory on thousands of data visualizations. Over the years, I have noticed that the same issues arise over and over. I have attempted to collect my accumulated knowledge from these interactions in the form of this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, approximately half of the planned chapters are completed, and all completed chapters are available online. I will post future chapters as they become available. Since this is a work in progress, not everything may be completely finalized, and I may rewrite some of the posted chapters at a later date. I welcome feedback. If you see any errors or other problems, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz/issues&#34;&gt;open an issue on github.&lt;/a&gt; If you have suggestions for other topics to cover, or for datasets that would work well for certain chapters, please also feel free to record these suggestions as issues on github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With very few exceptions, all figures in the book are generated straight from ggplot2, with no manual post-processing in photoshop or illustrator. (At present, the only exception is two figures in the chapter on &lt;a href=&#34;https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/image-file-formats.html&#34;&gt;image file formats.&lt;/a&gt;) Therefore, the book also serves as a showcase of what ggplot2 can do. I am using the bleeding edge of ggplot2 software development, though. To reproduce all the figures in the book, you may have to install current development versions of several R packages.&lt;/p&gt;
